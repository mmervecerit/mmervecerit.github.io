I work on:
- Human-centered AI
- Behavioral modeling & everyday digital behavior
- Digital health & wellbeing
- Interdisciplinary collaboration

across research (Screenome, person-specific modeling, AI companions), startups (formerly Little Tingz, Atypical AI), industry (formerly Microsoft Data & AI), and teaching (Stanford, MIT Media Lab).

If you’re working on digital health, behavioral modeling, wellbeing tech, AI companions, or tools that support human agency around personal data, I’d love to connect.
