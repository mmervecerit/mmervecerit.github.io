I’m an engineer–researcher–tinkerer working at the intersection of AI, behavioral and mental health, and everyday-life digital traces. My work focuses on turning messy, granular, multimodal data into person-specific (n=1) models, digital biomarkers, and translational tools that support real people in real contexts.

I care deeply about:
	•	Human agency — people understanding and shaping their own data, behaviors, and decisions
	•	Continuous, accessible care — moving beyond crisis-only, episodic systems toward everyday support
	•	Interdisciplinary collaboration — engineers, product teams, clinicians, and researchers working together as true partners
	•	Being technocritical but hopeful — clear-eyed about risks, committed to building AI that helps rather than harms

I’ve worked across:
	•	Research — Screenome, Media Content Atlas, person-specific modeling, AI companions, digital wellbeing interventions
	•	Startups — Co-founder & CTO (Little Tingz), founding generative AI engineer (Atypical AI)
	•	Industry — Data & AI Technical Specialist at Microsoft (MEA region)
	•	Teaching & community — Computer Vision for Social Science Research, MIT Media Lab Learning Creative Learning, UP School

I’m grateful to collaborate with an incredible group of mentors and colleagues, including Nick Haber, Roy Pea, Nilam Ram, Thomas N. Robinson, Byron Reeves, and Bethanie Maples.

This site brings together my projects, publications, and collaborations around AI, human behavior, and mental health. If you’re working in digital health, behavioral modeling, wellbeing technology, AI companions, or building agency around personal data, I’d love to connect.
